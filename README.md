Problem Statement: AI-Powered Brutal Resume Roaster
Many job seekers, particularly in the tech industry, struggle to receive truly honest, unfiltered, and actionable feedback on their resumes. Traditional resume reviews often lack the bluntness required to identify common, often ridiculed, pitfalls and clichés that can immediately disqualify a candidate in a competitive market. There's a significant gap in tools that provide feedback mirroring the highly critical, sarcastic, and often hilarious, yet insightful, commentary found in online communities like Reddit's resume critique threads or "Tech Roast Show" style content.

The problem is that job seekers lack access to a direct, no-holds-barred resume critique mechanism that exposes glaring weaknesses and common blunders with the brutal honesty and specific, actionable (though painfully delivered) advice needed to truly stand out.

This application aims to solve this by providing an AI-powered platform that:

Delivers Mercilessly Honest Feedback: Emulates the highly critical, sarcastic, and unvarnished style of online tech communities and "roast" shows to highlight resume flaws.

Identifies Common Pitfalls: Pinpoints clichés, formatting disasters, and questionable choices that are frequently ridiculed by recruiters and industry veterans.

Provides Multi-Modal Output: Presents this raw feedback in a detailed textual "roast," a concise audio summary, and blunt, actionable flashcards for quick learning and retention of painful truths.

By offering this unique, albeit harsh, perspective, the "Resume Roaster" empowers users to identify and rectify critical errors that might otherwise go unnoticed, ultimately improving their chances of securing interviews by truly hardening their resume against the most cynical of eyes.
